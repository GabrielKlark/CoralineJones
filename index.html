        <h1> Coraline Jones</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p> Coraline Jones is a curious adventurer who is the protagonist of all Coraline productions. She moved from Pontiac, Michigan with her parents to the Pink Palace Apartments in Ashland, Oregon. With her parents perpetually working and offering little attention to her, Coraline is incredibly bored and neglected thus decides to become an explorer of their new living location.</p>
            <p> While exploring, Coraline finds a small door sealed off by a brick wall. That night, Coraline is awakened by a mouse and follows it to the small door where she discovers a long, dark corridor in the brick wall's place. Coraline goes through it and finds herself in the other world´, a fantastical version of the Pink Palace inhabited by doppelgangers and better versions of her parents called the other mother and other father, who have black buttons for eyes. These beings prove to be warmer and more attentive than Coraline's real parents, particularly the other mother, who does everything she can to impress Coraline. Coraline decides to stay the night at the other world, but when she wakes the next morning, she finds herself in her old world. </p>

        <h1> Beldam (Other Mother) </h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p> The Beldam, is the main antagonist. best known as the "Other Mother" to her victims, is a shape-shifting entity who can transform into any child's mother in order to lure kids into the other world and eventually keep them captive. In order to entice and lure her victims, she creates beautiful things in the other world that contrast the dull and boring things of the real world. After ingratiating herself with the child, she convinces them to let her sew buttons into their eyes in order to consume their lives and steal their souls.</p>
            <p> The Other Mother is notably taller and thinner than her real mother. Her black hair seems to move by itself, her skin is paper-white, and her nails are long and red. Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself and ends up finding the "Other World" more interesting than her own. </p>
